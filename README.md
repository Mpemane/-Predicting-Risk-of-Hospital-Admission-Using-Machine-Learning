# -Predicting-Risk-of-Hospital-Admission-Using-Machine-Learning
This project explores a real-world healthcare dataset to develop a machine learning model that predicts hospital admission risk. The goal is to support early intervention by identifying high-risk patients using historical claims and behavior data.
